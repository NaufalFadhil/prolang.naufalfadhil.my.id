## Java Runtime Environment (JRE) and Java Development Kit (JDK)

### Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
The Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is a software package that provides the necessary libraries, Java Virtual Machine (JVM), and other components to run Java applications. It does not include development tools such as compilers or debuggers. The JRE is primarily intended for end-users who want to run Java programs.

### Java Development Kit (JDK)
The Java Development Kit (JDK) is a complete software development kit used to develop Java applications. It includes the JRE along with development tools such as the Java compiler (javac), debugger, and other utilities needed for Java programming. The JDK is intended for developers who want to create Java applications.

### Key Differences
- **Purpose**: JRE is for running Java applications, while JDK is for developing Java applications.
- **Components**: JRE includes the JVM and libraries, whereas JDK includes the JRE plus development tools.
- **Target Audience**: JRE is aimed at end-users, while JDK is aimed at developers.

### Summary
In summary, if you want to run Java applications, you need the JRE. If you want to develop Java applications, you need the JDK, which includes the JRE along with additional development tools.
